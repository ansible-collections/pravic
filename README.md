## Using this collection

The `pravic.pravic` collection enables use of ansible-playbook to manage a set of resources which have been declared in a `resources.yml` file.  

Given a `playbook.yml` file of:

```yaml

- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars_files:
    - resources.yml
  tasks:
    - name: cloud_1
      pravic.pravic.resources:
        state: "{{ state | default('present') }}"
        connection:
          profile_name: content

    - name: cloud_2
      pravic.pravic.resources:
        state: "{{ state | default('present') }}"
        connection:
          profile_name: content
```

And a `resources.yaml` file:

```yaml
pravic.pravic.resources/cloud_1:
  - name: bucket_01
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: ansible-declared-state-01
      Tags:
        - Key: otherbucket
          Value: resource:bucket_02.Properties.Arn

  - name: bucket_02
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: ansible-declared-state-02

  - name: bucket_03
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: ansible-declared-state-03

pravic.pravic.resources/cloud_2:
  - name: bucket_01
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: ansible-declared-state-04
```

Executing `ansible-playbook playbook.yml` with a set of valid AWS credentials would create the specified S3 buckets.  Notably, the resource named `bucket_01` depends on the ARN of `bucket_02`.  The pravic collection will [resolve references](https://github.com/ansible-collections/pravic/blob/main/plugins/module_utils/resource.py) between resources and determine the correct order to execute API calls to create resources in as well as automatically supplying the value without the playbook author needing to include a task to query the S3 API for the bucket info and register the ARN as an Ansible variable.
